# XRB-Lx-Lr-Sample
X-ray and radio luminosity samples of hard-state neutron stars and black holes. The individual files seperately contain the datapoints for the neutron star and black hole sample, and the references for each individual source. 

This data sample is used in a systematic sample study by Gallo, Degenaar & Van den Eijnden (2018; MNRAS accepted; https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01905) and the study of the super-Eddington X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 by Van den Eijnden et al. (submitted).
